# Project 1 - Create An App

The goal of this project is to familiarize the student with the basic concepts necessary to build a front end app (including topics in HTML, CSS & JS).

By the end of the project...
* ...they should be familiar with the proper terms to google/discuss their work
* ... they should know the different components of a front end app and understand their functions (HTML to structure, CSS to style, JS to make dynamic, you can use data from another app)
* ... they should know how to implement code examples we give them. (So not do everything by themselves, that is way to difficult. However, if we would ask them to build the same app again, using a different data source, they should be able to build it)
* ... they should have their first app pushed to github

Key word here are introducing and implementing. Actually applying their JS will be done in a project on day 5 and during the homework.
