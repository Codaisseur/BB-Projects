# Stage 03: DOM - creating a form

## Learning Goals
* [ ] The student can use the javascript console of their devTools to inspect the DOM and try their JS
* [ ] The student knows and can use HTML elements to create a form
* [ ] The students knows how to find, create, update and delete elements on a page
* [ ] The student understands that `document.getElementById()` always returns an object and that you can (re)assign values to properties of this object
* [ ] The student know how to store data that has been found in the DOM in a variable
    * (like: `const inputField = document.getElementById('name');`)
* [ ] How to interpolate a variable into a string
* [ ] The student can use user input (event Listeners/Handlers) to make their page dynamic
* [ ] The student knows the proper terms to discuss their work:
    * declare
    * (re)assign
    * string interpolation
    * object, property, value
