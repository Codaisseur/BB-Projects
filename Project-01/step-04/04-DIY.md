# DIY - Fine Tuning 

## 🎨 What we will build
In this section, you will display info from the data set we introduced you to on your details page and you will fine tune your index page according to some specifications.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of this step, you will learn:

* [] to recognize composite data structures.
* [] to select specific data from complex data structures.
* [] how to use an iterator to create elements on a page with content from an array

## ✏️ Assignments

#### More data manipulation
Some customers have very specific wishes. Let's implement them!

* Create a new branch called `feat/index-according-to-specifications`
* Update your index page to fulfill the following requirements:
  * It should only display paintings with a `width` bigger than `500`.
  * It should not display any paintings created by `Honthorst`.
  * It should only display paintings which are create before 1800.
* Push your changes to GitHub and merge your branch to master.

#### Detail Page
Use the data we gave you to display info on a single painting on your detail page. It is fine to create only one page, with details of one painting.

Make sure to work on a separate branch in git, when you are done, merge your branch into master.
