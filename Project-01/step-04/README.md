# Step 03: DOM - creating a form

## üé® What we will build
In this part you are going to display paintings on your index page based on an actual api response!

## üéØ Learning Goals
By the end of this step, you will learn:

* [] to recognize composite data structures.
* [] to select specific data from complex data structures.
* [] how to use an iterator to create elements on a page with content from an array



## üìö Modules that will be discussed

Please checkout the following modules before you start working on this step:

  * [Internet 1 ]()
  * [HTML 2 ]()
  * [Chrome DevTools 3]()
  * [JavaScript 1]()
  * [JavaScript 2]()
  * [JavaScript 3]()
  * [JavaScript 4]()
  * [DOM 1]()

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Help
See how far you can get on your own. We'll try to resemble your working future environment: if you get stuck, first check out the modules again or try to google your question. If that does not solve your issue, ask your classmates or teachers to help out. 

However **always** ask for help if you get stuck for longer then 15 minutes, if the assignment is not clear to you or if you feel like your progress is too slow to finish the assignments.

## Learning Goals
* [ ] The student recognizes composite data structures (arrays, nested objects, etc)
* [ ] The student understands you can fetch data from other apis and can implement code examples we give to fetch some data. (Not do it themselves, only understand what, not necessarily how!)
* [ ] The student can use an iterator to create elements on the page with content from the array
* [ ] The student knows the proper terms to discuss their work:
    * Array, elements
    * Api
    * callback (in iterator)
