## üé® What we will build
By then end of this section, your page will look like this one:

## üéØ Learning Goals
By the end of this section, you will learn:

* [ ] some important HTML tags, and when/why you should use them

## üìö Modules that will be discussed

  * [HTML 1](or2?)
  * [Git 2](orGitHub?)

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercises
### Adding `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>` and `<section>` elements
Let's make sure our page has something to show!

1. Thinking in 'boxes', we could split up the page as like the image below. The different level of boxes are color coded. The outer box has a blue border, the boxes inside the blue border are grey, the boxes inside the grey border are black and the boxes inside the black border are orange. Using the elements in your DevTools, can you assign each elements in the list below to the right color?
    * `<body></body>`
    * `<main></main>`
    * `<footer></footer>`
    * `<h1></h1>`
    * `<section id="gallery"></section>`
    * `<p></p>`
    * `<a href="..."></a>`

2. Now that we have an overview of all elements on our page, let's start building one. The first two elements we encounter inside our body, are the elements with a black border. Checking our DevTools, we can see these are a `<main>` and a `<footer>` element. Add those elements inside the `<body>` element on your page!

3. We'll continue working on the main section. Opening your DevTools, can you see which elements should be inside your `<main>` element? Make sure to also add the attributes. If there are no nested elements anymore, also add the content, change "Mimi"  to your own name!

> Your code should now look like this:
>```html
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <title>Museum Guide</title>
>  </head>
>  <body>
>   <main>
>     <h1> _YOUR_NAME_ Mobile Museum App</h1>
>     <section id="gallery">
>
>     </section>
>   </main>
>  </body>
></html>
>```

Your page should now look something like this:

### Adding `<a>` and `<img>` elements
The main framework is there, all we need to add is the content of the 'boxes' with orange borders:
![Page in boxes](https://cd.sseu.re/MuseumGuide_2018-11-28_18-50-13.png)

1. Check the `<section>` element in your DevTools. What does it contain? 
![inside section element](https://cd.sseu.re/MuseumGuide_2018-11-29_15-17-25.png)
2. Add an `<h2>` element to your `<section>` element, with the content: 'Gallery'.
3. Add 5 `<a>` elements to your `<section>` element. Assign all their `href`-attributes to "./pages/detail-page.html".
4. Inside each `<a>` element, add a `<img>` element. Give each of them an attribute with the name "class"  and as value the string "artObject". Don't forget to add a 'source' and an 'alt' attribute! Pick the 5 images you like best, or find your own, anywhere on the internet!

> ## üëå Pro-tip
> _When using picture from the internet, you should use the `image address` of the picutre. You can find it by right-clicking on any image and select `copy image address`_

### Create a footer
Inspect the footer and add the code to your `index.html` file!

### Push your work to GH:
1. Stage your changes, commit them and push them to GitHub:

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Add all elements to index page'
$ ggpush
```
