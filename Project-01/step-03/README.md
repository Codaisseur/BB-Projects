# Step 03: DOM - creating a form

## üé® What we will build
In this part you are going to make the comment form on your detail page actually do something!

## üéØ Learning Goals
By the end of this step, you will learn:

* [ ] how to select, create and adjust elements from a page
* [ ] how to declare and call functions
* [ ] how to check JavaScript in your DevTools
* [ ] how to store data in a variable
* [ ] how to (re)assign values to a property of a DOM-element.

## üìö Modules that will be discussed

Please checkout the following modules before you start working on this step:

  * [Internet 1 ]()
  * [HTML 2 ]()
  * [Chrome DevTools 3]()
  * [JavaScript 1]()
  * [JavaScript 2]()
  * [JavaScript 3]()
  * [JavaScript 4]()
  * [DOM 1]()

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Help
See how far you can get on your own. We'll try to resemble your working future environment: if you get stuck, first heck out the modules again or try to google your question. If that does not solve your issue, ask your classmates or teachers to help out. 

However **always** ask for help if you get stuck for longer then 15 minutes, if the assignment is not clear to you or if you feel like your progress is too slow to finish the assignments.

# DEVELOPERS ONLY - DELETE LATER

## Learning Goals
* [ ] The student can use the javascript console of their devTools to inspect the DOM and try their JS
* [ ] The student knows and can use HTML elements to create a form
* [ ] The students knows how to find, create, update and delete elements on a page
* [ ] The student understands that `document.getElementById()` always returns an object and that you can (re)assign values to properties of this object
* [ ] The student know how to store data that has been found in the DOM in a variable
    * (like: `const inputField = document.getElementById('name');`)
* [ ] How to interpolate a variable into a string
* [ ] The student can use user input (event Listeners/Handlers) to make their page dynamic
* [ ] The student knows the proper terms to discuss their work:
    * declare
    * (re)assign
    * string interpolation
    * object, property, value

# Modules
  * Internet 1 (intro to HTTP needed to understand forms, mention domain names and IP addresses)
  * HTML 2 (forms, inputs, buttons, labels)
  * Chrome DevTools 3 (using the console to run JavaScript and see messages)
  * JavaScript 1 (variables, declarations, (re-)assignments, primitive types)
  * JavaScript 2 (operators numeric/boolean/string, string interpolation)
  * JavaScript 3 (compound/composite data types arrays and objects, properties, adding/removing elements, array.length, array methods push, pop?, shift?, unshift?)
  * JavaScript 4 (functions, parameters v arguments, functions as values, methods, `this`)
  * JavaScript 5 (flow control, for, while, if, switch)
  * JavaScript 6 (scope and visibility)
  * DOM 1 (querying document, manipulating elements, creating elements, `<script>` tags in HTML)
  * DOM 2 (event listeners, addEventListener v on* properties v on* attributes)
