#### Inspecting CSS with Chrome DevTools
The goals of the following assignments is to answer all your CSS questions by experimenting with the DevTools. The answers themselves are not too important, you should however be able to figure out an answer using your DevTools.

* Check out the Styles Section of your Chrome DevTools. Uncheck the box in front of `padding: 2rem 0`. What happens?

* What does the `text-align` property to?
* Click on the value of the `background` property and change the last two digits to `#FFBAAA`. What happens? What does the `back-ground`-property do? What does the value specify?

* Change the value of the `width`-property. What happens? Change the percentage to something else. What happens when you replace the `%`-sign with `px`, `em`, `rem` or some random letters?
* Click behind `text-align: center` and type: `color: blue`. What happens?
* Refresh the page. What do you notice?
* Inspect the title of the page (`Mimi's mobile museum app`). Which values are specified for the `margin`-property? Change the values one by one to figure out which value specifies which side of the box.
* Toggle the view to mobile. Change your view from `Galaxy S5` to `iPad`. Try some other screens.
