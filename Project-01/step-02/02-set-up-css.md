### Creating a new branch
As we are starting on a new part of this project, we will be creating a new branch. 

* In your terminal, navigate to your project.
* Make sure you are on the master branch and you have pulled the latest version of:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ ggpull
```

>  _‚ùóÔ∏è If it did not work, make sure you did **not** copy the dollar sign and that you copied the commands **one line at the time**!_ 

* Create a new branch and check it out using `git checkout -b feat/style-index-and-detail-page`.

You are ready to go!

### Setting Up your CSS
* In your terminal, inside your project directory, open your project in your editor using the command `code .`.
* In VSC, in the main directory of your project, create a new file called `index.css`.
* At the bottom of the the `<head>`-section of `index.html`, add the following line:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="index.css">
```
* In `index.css`, add a rule that sets the background color of the body element to #FFBA00.
```
* Open `index.html` in your browser (or refresh the page if you had it opened, still) and check what happened.
* In your editor, change the background color to your favorite color.
