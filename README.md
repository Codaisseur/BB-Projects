# Revising BB

## Why?

* The current material is tough to maintain. Teachers are not always aware of the changes that other teachers make, or how changing a topic influences other days

* Students have difficulties using the reader as a reference, because all info is wrapped in projects

* We want to grow the number of hirable 'strong independent developers' exponentially. A way to do so is to design the course material in such a way that a student could work with it on their own.

## How

* Separate exercises (projects) and theories (modules) 
  * To make maintaining easier (you only have to change or add modules and make sure the topics are incorporated in the project)
  * To make it easier to use the reader as a reference
  * Would open the opportunity to make small video lectures about each topic

* Defining clear learning objectives
  * To make students agents of their own learning (they know what they understand and what they should work on)
  * To help prioritize changes we make as teachers in the material
  * Making it easier to assess learning and the effect of changes in the curriculum on the learning of students.


* Proposed class structure:
  * **09:30-10:30** Recap
  * **10:30-15:30** Students work on project, attend lectures (max 3 of 45 min.)
  * **15:30-18:00** Read for next day, practice what you have difficulties with.

## Definitions
  * **A project**
    * Always has a useful end result which can be pushed to GitHub
    * Introduces the concepts discussed in modules in context
    * Consists of:
      * An index page explaining:
        * Intro
          * An introduction of what we will build/discuss in this project
        * 🎨 What we will build
          * A visual representation of what the student should see on the screen by the end of this step
        * 📚 Modules that will be discussed
          * Title (with links) of the modules that are necessary to understand to complete this step
      * Different steps, which have to be completed in order (see below)

  * **A step**
    * Can be completed without any external help (all info should be in the modules)
    * Starts and ends with a quiz to assess the students learning 
    * Contains:
      * An index page explaining:
        * 🎨 What we will build
          * A visual representation of what the student should see on the screen by the end of this step
        * 🎯 Learning Goals
          * 4-5 (general) learning goals
        * 📚 Modules that will be discussed
          * Title (with links) of the modules that are necessary to understand to complete this step
      * 1-5 sections which each contain:
        * 🎨 What we will build
          * A visual representation of what the student should see on the screen by the end of this section
        * 🎯 Learning Goals
          * A subset of the learning goals described in the 'parent step' which will be discussed in this section
        * 📚 Modules that will be discussed
          * Title (with links) of a subset of the modules that were defined in this step which are needed for this specific section
        * ✏️ Exercises
          * A set of exercises that will lead to the outcome presented in _What we will be build_ at the top of the page and are connected to the _Learning Goals_.
          * Focus is on implementing code examples and applying knowledge, not on understanding, so there should be no/hardly any explanation.
        * 😱  Sanity Check(s)
          * An example of what the page/could should look like, the feedback a student can expect from the terminal, etc.
          * Should be at least one at the end of the section which shows/links to example code
        * 👌 Pro-tip(s)
          * Optional, offering alternative, easier ways or best practices which are not necessary to make it work, but do improve your skills as a programmer
          * Presented after relevant step in exercise
        * ❗️ Most Common Errors
          * Answers to the questions that you are sure will be asked 😉
          * Presented after relevant step in exercise
        * 🎯 Learning Goal Tracker
          * An overview of all learning goals for this step and which ones have been achieved.

  * **A module**
    * Is independent from a projects/steps (can be used for different projects)
    * Is about 10.000 words long (a 30 min. read) and never longer then 20.000 words (a 60 min. read) 
    * Consists of...
      * a list of modules that should be read to understand the current module
      * a set of max 5 learning goals
      * a quiz to assess student learning before and after reading
      * an explanation of a set of topics
      * some coding examples/screenshots where the concepts are put into context
      * extra exercises for students to practice (should only be done if necessary, after project)
