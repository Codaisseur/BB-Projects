# Revising BB

## Why?
* We want to grow the number of hirable 'strong independent developers' exponentially. A way to do so is to design the course material in such a way that a student could work with it on their own.

* The current material is tough to maintain. Teachers are not always aware of the changes that other teachers make, or how changing a topic influences other days

* Students have difficulties using the reader as a reference, because all info is wrapped in projects

## How

* Separate exercises (projects) and theories (modules) 
    * To make maintaining easier (you only have to change or add modules and make sure the topics are incorporated in the project)
    * To make it easier to use the reader as a reference

* Defining clear learning objectives so students know in which topics they have to spend some extra time

* Proposed class structure:
    * **09:30-10:30** Recap
    * **10:30-15:30** Students work on project, attend lectures (max 3 of 45 min.)
    * **15:30-18:00** Read for next day, practice what you have difficulties with.

## Definition
  * A project
    * consists of different stages, which have to be completed in order
    * Always has a useful end result which can be pushed to GitHub
    * Introduces the concepts discussed in modules in context

  * A stage
    * Consists of 4-5 learning goals per stage presented at the beginning of the stage
    * Can be completed without any external help (all info should be in the modules)
    * Should link to max 5 modules, which should be mentioned at the beginning of each state
    * Starts and ends with a quiz to assess the students learning 

  * A module
    * Is independent from a projects/stages (can be used for different projects)
    * Is about 10.000 words long (a 30 min. read) and never longer then 20.000 words (a 60 min. read) 
    * Consists of...
      * a list of modules that should be read to understand the current module
      * a set of max 5 learning goals
      * a quiz to assess student learning before and after reading
      * an explanation of a set of topics
      * some coding examples/screenshots where the concepts are put into context
      * extra exercises for students to practice (should only be done if necessary, after project)
